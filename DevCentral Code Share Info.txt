# Title

APM Session & Cookie Information - Chrome Extension



# Problem this snippet solves

If you've ever troubleshooted *APM Portal Access* issues, you know how annoying it can be to find the decoded internal url. 

This chrome extension seeks to make that quick and easy by showing the decoded internal url. It will also display the cookies for that site, so the `MRHSession` and `LastMRH_Session` cookie values can be determined quickly as well.

#### Version History
* **v1.1**
  * Includes APM portal access decoded url information
  * Includes list of cookies associated with the current site
  
  


# How to use this snippet

As Chrome doesn't really like unpublished extensions, and it's not in the *Chrome App Store* (yet), you'll have to install the extension in *Developer Mode*.

#### Instructions

* Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
* Ensure that the `Developer mode` checkbox is enabled
* Sub-Method 1: Load unpacked extension
  * Download all the code from the [Github repository](https://github.com/jangins101/F5-APM-Session-Information)
  * Click the `Load unpacked extension` button and select the `src` folder
* Sub-Method 2: Load the *crx* file
  * Download the [crx](https://github.com/jangins101/F5-APM-Session-Information/raw/master/F5%20APM%20URL%20Decoder.crx) from the [Github repository](https://github.com/jangins101/F5-APM-Session-Information)
  * From the file system, click and drag the `.crx` file onto the extension page to installation it
